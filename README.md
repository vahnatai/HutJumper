 To run the game locally (on a machine with Python installed) checkout the repository and run:
    ./start.sh [port_number]
or 
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port_number]

If no port is specified, the game defaults to attempting to use port 8000.
The game will then be available on your machine at http://localhost:8000 (or whichever port you chose).
